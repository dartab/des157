            <p>The article goes through the history of the zine. It first reviews the zine’s origins as DIY, counterculture, and anti-authoritarian. Zines were historically self-published, low cost or free, with a small scale, niche reach. However, there
                are now more mainstream-oriented zine publications, and the line between “zine” and “magazine” isn’t always clear, since many small-scale zines have turned into large-scale corporate magazines. Perhaps the biggest difference is that zines
                are traditionally community oriented. The first zine was the 1930’s sci-fi publication “The Comet”. Sci-fi fandom and zine history was interconnected in the 20th century, and zines were originally called “fanzines”, which often honored
                a particular cult franchise. The mimeograph process was used to create the first zines, involving pushing ink through stencils. However, by the 70’s, with the advent of the copy machine, zine creation was done cheaply and quickly, and
                the style totally transformed. Zines became popular in punk culture of the 70’s and 80’s, paying homage to bands like The Clash, The Ramones, and Joy Division. In the 1990’s, zines were revived as a part of the Riot Grrrl scene and integrated
                into feminist groups, allowing them to finally become accessible to women as well as men. Bust and Bitch magazines started as zines before they became major publications. Today, zines exist online and offline, and reflect artist and community
                collaboration about a variety of topics.

            <p>Written in 1997, this article is interesting in that it references Salon and Slate as somewhat counter-cultural web publications (now fairly mainstream). It speaks to the unique capability of the web as an interface (in contrast with print)
                for communicating ideas - including linking and having audio and video — all things we take for granted today, as most mainstream publications have a mirroring web zine or newspaper, and many people solely subscribe to the online version
                (such as the New York Times). It also speaks about the power of having “online forums” — which today we refer to as comments, where readers can debate issues. Another interesting thing to note is that this article brings up the fact that
                reading on a screen is difficult (still true on most computers) and so shorter articles do better. Overall, this article is interesting in that it speaks to a time before online media was commonplace, and mainstream outlets were still
                trying to figure out the best way to make use of the online medium. We have a come a long way since then, and with the widespread acceptance and use of internet devices, we have learned to tell stories in a different way.

            <p>This article focuses on a south London artist collective Born N Bread, who created a zine about food, fandom, and black British identity. The article, more contemporary than the others, touches on the fact that self-publishing is so ubiquitous
                (for example, everyone’s Twitter and Instagram accounts) that it would appear to be the end of DIY zines as a part of counter-culture. However, the prevalence of a particular kind of self-publishing over social media, the article argues,
                gives way for people wanting something different that harkens back to traditional zines, like a physical pamphlet. The Born N Bread collective particularly enjoys the printed medium, since it has that physicality in creation, and there
                is “no going back” or post-editing like one might be able to do online. And it is an endlessly creative process. I find this interesting because it is a reclamation of a traditional format, yet they don’t seem to attempt to create a web-equivalent
                of their zine, which is something I would like to try (and which could certainly diverge from current forms of self-publishing over social media, however would probably reference it, as I think it is important as a phenomenon to acknowledge).
