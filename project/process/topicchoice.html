            <h2>
      project topic choice: web zine with 3 issues
    </h2>
            <p>I would like to create an internet zine as a way to visually express thoughts around current issues and explore virtual renditions of real and imagined places. We live in a world in which our perceptions are constantly informed by the technologies
                we use, and our memories are created by the way we curate lives over internet media. This zine will serve as a sort of memory archive, collective journal, and exercise in digital worldbuilding.</p>
            <h3>Topics considered are:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heaven, hell & the occult</li>
                <li>Hypochondria, paranoia, and conspiracy theories influenced by web access</li>
                <li>Gender dynamics in an age of digital communications and a reclamation of and reaction against feminism</li>
                <li>Clowns, fear of clowns, and the uncanny valley</li>
                </li>
                <li>Memories of being an 11 year old computer nerd in 1998: a boybands webring</li>
                <li>An enchanted interactive virtual hotspring</li>
                <li>An immersive virtual psychic experience, where fortunes are read</li>
                <li>Reflections and perceptions of a post-inauguration Facebook</li>
                <li>Cyborgs and surveillance</li>
                <li>Fake news about fake news</li>
                <li>A visual digital interpretation of the insides of Donald Trump's brain</li>
                <li>Reflections on mental health and issues</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To start for this project, I am going to work on “Heaven, hell & the occult”, "An enchanted interactive virtual hotspring" and “Fake news about fake news”, while keeping open the possibility that I may want to combine or modify
                some of these topic ideas.</p>
