            <h2>
      audience test results
    </h2>
            <p>During my audience tests, I saw how three different people interacted with my project, navigated through the site, and reacted to the content. I gained helpful insight in how to structure the site hierarchically and also as to what information is missing conceptually to better communicate what the project is about.</p>

            <h3>Here are some specific learnings that I will modify for the final delivery:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There needs to a a consistent floating logo in the top left that navigates back to the homepage</li>
                <li>There needs to a a consistent floating logo in the top left that navigates back to the homepage</li>
                <li>More details needed for “about” section - likely will need a separate page - specifically, why do all these elements belong together?</li>
                <li>On the homepage, there should be a tagline or explanation front and center explaining what this is</li>
                </li>
                <li>The “upcoming” page needs more explanation, specifics of file types and the story and concept behind the upcoming zine</li>
                <li>Submissions should go on the same page as “upcoming,” as in its current state it appears to be done and in progress</li>
                <li>If an issue is complete and in process, that could go on the homepage</li>
                <li>Less pages are better</li>
                <li>Title should be explained somewhere on the site, perhaps in “about” section</li>
            </ol>
