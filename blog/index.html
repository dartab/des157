            Chapter 10. Mobile: It’s not just a city in Alabama anymore
      </h2>
            <p>Author Steve Krug breaks down the three most important elements to consider in mobile design: trade-offs, affordances, and usability. Mobile designs must accommodate a much smaller screen size than a desktop, so there are trade-offs to consider
                when creating a mobile site. The designer must learn to prioritize the most crucial information, since elements will have to be left out on mobile. However, he notes that designers must still ensure usability of a mobile site or app, despite
                this reduction in real-estate.</p>
            <p>Affordances, the visual clues that suggest how we use a design, must also be especially noticeable on mobile designs, since there is no cursor to hover over elements that are clickable. Krug argues that flat design makes it more difficult
                to differentiate between clickable elements and plain text, and discourages the trend.</p>
            <p>Mobile designs also need to prioritize usability. Apps and mobile sites should not require a lot of training to use, and their functionality should be memorable, so that you can open the app a second time and know how it works. Given the diversity
                of devices in use, all sites must be usable on all screen sizes, and allow for zooming in case the text is too small. The design should also provide a link to the full site, in case there is a feature missing on the mobile site that a
                user wants to utilize. And finally, mobile sites must load quickly, as download speeds are variable on mobile devices.</p>
            <p>When user testing mobile apps, Krug recommends using a camera pointed at the screen so you can see the user’s gestures. The camera itself should be attached to the mobile device, so the user can hold the phone naturally.</p>
            <p>Our critical take on Krug’s overview is that he hits on very valid points, and in my experience it is certainly very challenging, but essential, to design well for multi-screen sizes. This is the case especially with mobile, which is increasingly
                the most popular way to engage with the internet. We thought that he should have discussed the differences between mobile web design and mobile app design. We also disagreed that flat design was a flop — it is familiar enough that we can
                recognize its affordances.</p>
            <p>Our example is the Airbnb app, which we compared with the company’s website. The app seems to focus more on managing already planned trips, whereas the website is more focused on booking. While the website is clean and spacious with few icons,
                the app is a little more crowded with all icons visible upfront. The website benefits, most obviously, from its increased real-estate, as well as the ability to have drop down menus and interactive hover-over effects. The app is successful
                it its display of affordances, with clear navigation tabs and a search bar at the top. One needs to scroll up to get more search options, which is not obvious, but learnable. There doesn’t appear to be anything critical left out of the
                mobile design when compared with the website version. As such, the app is a successful interpretation of the website for a mobile device.</p>

      studio 5 sound library
      </h2>
            <a href="../studio5/index.html"><img width="600" height="488" src="images/studio5.png" alt="studio5"></a>
            <p>My goal for this project was to experiment with a sound library. This ended up being a lot of fun because the outcome was something like a sound mixer, and I have not tried to experiment re-mixing my songs since they were recorded six or seven
                years ago. The <a href="http://www.createjs.com/soundjs">soundJS</a> library seems pretty robust and relatively simple given its functionality but I could easily spend the rest of the quarter (and beyond) exploring it and trying to understand
                how it works. For some reason I struggled with getting the js out of the inline format — the examples, as well as the “Getting Started” tutorials all demonstrate using inline code, and whenever I tried to put the js on a separate document
                something got disconnected, so this is something I need to look into. I would also in the future like to experiment with pause, stop/reset buttons, and volume controls.</p>

            <p>For this design I made a full picture with elements that work together as a defined environment — in this case, a psychic office! Elements that made for effective interaction include: 1. the tool tips over the psychic (Kate Bush), the crystal
                ball, and the elixir; 2. the animating star that starts working once the user clicks the ball; and 3. the alert that appears after clicking the elixir. I would like to eventually take this project further in making a popup from clicking
                the ball that randomly generates fortunes.</p>

            <p>I connected the visual elements of my design by firstly making it a cohesive picture, with mystery elements to click on that lead to the text box on the bottom. I also changed the cursor style to the hand pointer to make it obvious you can
                click on elements. When you hover over clickable elements, they also go from black and white to color, which implies an interactive component. The text box itself has a clickable (x) to close the box. I intend to add a timer to the picture
                element so that real photos of Ziggy appear as a slideshow.</p>

    gmail form input
  </h2>
            <img width="600" height="391" src="images/gmail.gif" alt="gmail">
            <p>My most used form input is Gmail, which is, of course, an email service that makes use of a rich text editor where users can embed images, change fonts, among other functions. Referring to Bill DeRouchey’s “<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">Learning IxD From Everyday Objects</a>”,
                I wouldn't exactly call Gmail’s interface “inspirational,” but it certainly has a clarity of purpose, and its simple interface allows for maximum management, organization, and understanding of content. Its simplicity (like in most Google
                apps) is its strong point, and the likely reason for its widespread success as an email host. There is a distinct hierarchy of elements on the interface, and it is helpful that emails are automatically sorted into certain folders and can
                also be color-labelled. However, there is a certain amount of sifting one has to do on their own, and much of the strength of the platform lies in the robust search function.

      effective user interface design: slack
    </h2>
            <img src="images/slack.gif" width="600" height="391" alt="slack">
            <p>
                I don’t regularly use Slack anymore, but I appreciate it as a design that harkens back to basics, namely, the online chatroom. As a glorified chatroom and messaging system, it has a surprising breadth of purpose, both social and commercial. Slack makes
                use of color beautifully and cleanly, and, in the spirit of contemporary design, it is very simple aesthetically and easy to use. Slack’s use of color to create organization and hierarchy as well as a search bar (the modus operandi for
                most web-based applications these days) creates an intuitiveness in the same vein as the iPhone's messaging app. I have found Slack to be somewhat less useful for delegating tasks in a corporate setting, since it is not very robust in
                terms of manual organization. But I appreciate that the old school chatroom — like we found with AOL back in the day, or even Netscape web forums — is coming back into style in this format. It is one of my favorite things one can do on
                the web, is a great way to share your live brain stream in a manner that is not as high-pressure as a direct email or text message.
